# Music Analysis

I wanted to understand whether it is possible to make a good recommendation system that takes into account only statistics of lyrics.  
And for this I needed data, since I didn't see suitable open datasets.  
So, after collecting the dataset, it was decided to open-source it on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/detkov/lyrics-dataset). Also, every related work and analysis will also be there.  

UPD: dataseton kaggle was deleted, so now you can get it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10FOIW80rjwTsudtsB8wQhs0q9arn9_gj?usp=sharing).  
Songs Dataset contains 253 678 songs with 10 features:  
"Singer, Album, Song, Date, Featuring, Genre, Lyrics, Tags, Producers, Writers"
